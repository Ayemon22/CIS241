My name is Aye Myat Mon. My friends and family call me Aye. I am from Myanmar and currently living in Lynnwood. My hobbies are watching movies and traveling around the world. 
My MBTI is INFJ and I am Pieces. I'm taking this course because this is required for my degree and I also would like to learn a few things related to web development. 
I have always wanted to learn HTML even though web development is not my major. I'm working on a CIS General ATA degree. This is my 4th quarter at Edmonds.

I have not decided which career I will choose but I am currently interested in Database Management. I want to learn more about Database Theory and Design and SQL language. 
I transferred from Shoreline Community College because they don't offer any CIS-related courses and I found out that Edmonds offers many CIS courses. That's why I transferred to Edmonds. 
I don't have any experience in the IT field except for taking a few courses related to IT. I would like to apply for an internship at any Company next quarter if I have an opportunity to do so. 
I am excited to learn new things.

I like listening to K-pop. I am a big fan of Korean boy bands called BTS and Seventeen. Whenever I feel like giving up, they give me hope that I can achieve everything if I try hard. 
I love to stay at home most of the time, so I prefer indoor activities like watching movies and reading books. I am an introvert who feels more comfortable focusing on my inner thoughts and ideas. 
That is why it is hard for me to express myself. I am slowly trying to get out of my comfort zone in the future.
