I honestly enjoyed CIS 241 Web Development 1. This is my first time learning how to build a website and I had so much fun. Now I know the fundamentals of Web Development. 
In this course, I learned how to use HTML5 to develop, debug, maintain, and document web applications and websites. 
</p>
<p class="margin" style="font-size:20px;">
The most fascinating thing I learned from this course is that we can change the font, color, and phrase elements with the formatting instructions in Cascading Style Sheets. 
Since all pages on my website can link to the same external style sheet, I don't need to change all elements across the site. 
I just need to do one simple change and do not need to change every page manually. This saves a great deal of development and maintenance time, and it also makes my website more consistent. 
</p>
<p class="margin" style="font-size:20px;">
Even though Web development is not my major, I will not forget the skills I got from this course. I learned a lot about how to use HTML5 forms and tables and how to create HTML5 style through CSS. 
I cannot believe I can finally develop my own website using the knowledge I got from this course.
